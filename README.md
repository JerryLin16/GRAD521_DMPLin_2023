Data Management Plan for GRAD521

Context for the DMP: here I will copy question 1 of DMP1
1.Describe briefly the research questions that you are trying to answer with your research.
In my research, we investigate strategies for enhancing anthocyanin-phenolic copigmentation on blueberry surface, and integrated copigmentation with layer-by-layer (LBL) coating to retain anthocyanin stability in thermally processed blueberries. The objectives of my study were 1) to investigate anthocyanin-phenolic copigmentation in whole fruit vs. fruit anthocyanin extract using blueberry as a fruit model, 2) to evaluate the effect of using surfactant and calcium ion treatments for enhancing the copigmentation complexation and its thermal stability in whole blueberries, and 3) to validate the effectiveness of combined copigmentation and LBL coatings for enhancing stability of anthocyanins and retaining anthocyanins within thermally processed blueberries in aqueous media. Retention of anthocyanins in whole fruit was evaluated by quantifying total monomeric anthocyanin (TMA) and percent polymeric color (PPC) of treated fruit in comparison with untreated one and observing the color of packing solution (photo). It is anticipated that an effective copigmentation treatment along with water-resistant edible coatings could enhance physical and chemical stability of fruit anthocyanin and quality of whole fruit during thermal process and ambient storage.

2.Describe the data that you will use to answer your research questions.
(1)	In my research, I have two different type of data, one is image data (observational data) and the other is experimental data (spreadsheets) and I use software (Minitab) to run data analysis. 
(2)	
a.	Canned fruit image (storage test): observational data (images)
Canned fruit was taking picture by using camera to observe the color different during storage time.
b.	Fruit quality analysis: experimental data (using Excel spreadsheet)
(a)	Total anthocyanin content:
3 g fruit skins were mixed with 30 mL 70% methanol in 50 mL centrifuge tubes (VWR, PA, USA). Extracts with tannic acid copigmentation before and after thermal process were scanned using an ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectrophotometer (UV-3100PC, VWR International, LLC, Radnor, PA, USA) between 400-700 nm at ambient conditions. All measurements were made between 15~60 min after sample preparation. The absorbance (A) of each sample at pH 1.0 and pH 4.5 was calculated as (λ510 – λ700nm)pH 1.0 - (λ510 – λ700nm)pH 4.5, and TMA (mh/L) was calculated as  (A × Mw × DF ×1000)/(ε × 1), where Mw and ε corresponded to cyanidin-3-glucoside with Mw= 449.2 g/mol and ε = 26,900 L/cm·mol. The unit was converted to mg/g dry fruit skin.
(b)	Percent polymeric color and λvis-max: 
Briefly, 0.2 mL of 0.2 g/mL potassium metabisulfite was added to 2.8 mL of diluted sample (bleached sample), whereas 0.2 mL of distilled water was also added to 2.8 mL of diluted sample (control sample). After equilibration for 30 min at ambient conditions, the absorbance of the bleached and control sample was measured at a wavelength of λ420 nm, λvis-max, and λ700 nm, respectively, using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The color density of the control sample and the polymeric color of the bleached sample were calculated as [(Aλ420nm –Aλ700nm) + (Aλvis-max –Aλ700nm)] x dilution factor, respectively. Percent polymeric color (PPC) was further calculated as polymeric color of bleached sample divided by color density of control sample and multiplied by 100%.
(c)	Color:
Fruit color (n=15) was measured using a colorimeter (LabScan XE, HunterLab, Virginia, USA) and reported as a* (red/green) and b* (blue/yellow) values.
(d)	Firmness: 
Fruit were compressed by 50 mm diameter flat cylindrical probe (P/50) in a TA-XT2 texture analyzer (Texture Technologies Corp., Scarsdale, NY, USA). The test parameters were 5 mm/s pre- and post-test speed, 1 mm/s test speed, 5 g trigger force, and 30% deformation ratio. The data were expressed as the means of 15 samples.
c.	Fruit skin cellular structures: observational data (images)
Blueberry skins (5 x 5 mm with <2 mm thickness of underlying tissues) were taken carefully using a razor blade. The tissues were mounted on slide glasses with a drop of distilled water and examined in bright field with x40 magnification using a Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope (Nikon Corporation, Japan) fitted with an Infinity 1–3C camera (Lumenera Corporation, Ottawa, ON, Canada).

3.For each dataset in question 2: describe how much data (approximately) will be created during the course of the project (MB, GB, TB, etc). 
a.	Canned fruit image (storage test): <1GB
b.	Fruit quality:
(a)	Total anthocyanin content<10MB
(b)	Percent polymeric color and λvis-max <10MB
(c)	Color <10MB
(d)	Firmness <10MB
c.	Fruit skin cellular structures <1GB
