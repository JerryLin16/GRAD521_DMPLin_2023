Context for the DMP: here I will copy question 1 of DMP1

Describe briefly the research questions that you are trying to answer with your research.

In my research, we investigate strategies for enhancing anthocyanin-phenolic copigmentation on blueberry surface, and integrated copigmentation with layer-by-layer (LBL) coating to retain anthocyanin stability in thermally processed blueberries. The objectives of my study were 1) to investigate anthocyanin-phenolic copigmentation in whole fruit vs. fruit anthocyanin extract using blueberry as a fruit model, 2) to evaluate the effect of using surfactant and calcium ion treatments for enhancing the copigmentation complexation and its thermal stability in whole blueberries, and 3) to validate the effectiveness of combined copigmentation and LBL coatings for enhancing stability of anthocyanins and retaining anthocyanins within thermally processed blueberries in aqueous media. Retention of anthocyanins in whole fruit was evaluated by quantifying total monomeric anthocyanin (TMA) and percent polymeric color (PPC) of treated fruit in comparison with untreated one and observing the color of packing solution (photo). It is anticipated that an effective copigmentation treatment along with water-resistant edible coatings could enhance physical and chemical stability of fruit anthocyanin and quality of whole fruit during thermal process and ambient storage.
