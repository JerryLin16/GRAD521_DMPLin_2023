Describe the data that you will use to answer your research questions.

In my research, I have two different type of data, one is image data (observational data) and the other is experimental data (spreadsheets) and I use software (Minitab) to run data analysis. 

## Model data

here description 

## Lab data
a.	Canned fruit image (storage test): observational data (images)

Canned fruit was taking picture by using camera to observe the color different during storage time.

b.	Fruit quality analysis: experimental data (using Excel spreadsheet)

(a)	Total anthocyanin content: 3 g fruit skins were mixed with 30 mL 70% methanol in 50 mL centrifuge tubes (VWR, PA, USA). Extracts with tannic acid copigmentation before and after thermal process were scanned using an ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectrophotometer (UV-3100PC, VWR International, LLC, Radnor, PA, USA) between 400-700 nm at ambient conditions. All measurements were made between 15~60 min after sample preparation. The absorbance (A) of each sample at pH 1.0 and pH 4.5 was calculated as (λ510 – λ700nm)pH 1.0 - (λ510 – λ700nm)pH 4.5, and TMA (mh/L) was calculated as  (A × Mw × DF ×1000)/(ε × 1), where Mw and ε corresponded to cyanidin-3-glucoside with Mw= 449.2 g/mol and ε = 26,900 L/cm·mol. The unit was converted to mg/g dry fruit skin.

(b)	Percent polymeric color and λvis-max: Briefly, 0.2 mL of 0.2 g/mL potassium metabisulfite was added to 2.8 mL of diluted sample (bleached sample), whereas 0.2 mL of distilled water was also added to 2.8 mL of diluted sample (control sample). After equilibration for 30 min at ambient conditions, the absorbance of the bleached and control sample was measured at a wavelength of λ420 nm, λvis-max, and λ700 nm, respectively, using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The color density of the control sample and the polymeric color of the bleached sample were calculated as [(Aλ420nm –Aλ700nm) + (Aλvis-max –Aλ700nm)] x dilution factor, respectively. Percent polymeric color (PPC) was further calculated as polymeric color of bleached sample divided by color density of control sample and multiplied by 100%.

(c)	Color: Fruit color (n=15) was measured using a colorimeter (LabScan XE, HunterLab, Virginia, USA) and reported as a* (red/green) and b* (blue/yellow) values.

(d)	Firmness: Fruit were compressed by 50 mm diameter flat cylindrical probe (P/50) in a TA-XT2 texture analyzer (Texture Technologies Corp., Scarsdale, NY, USA). The test parameters were 5 mm/s pre- and post-test speed, 1 mm/s test speed, 5 g trigger force, and 30% deformation ratio. The data were expressed as the means of 15 samples.

c.	Fruit skin cellular structures: observational data (images)

Blueberry skins (5 x 5 mm with <2 mm thickness of underlying tissues) were taken carefully using a razor blade. The tissues were mounted on slide glasses with a drop of distilled water and examined in bright field with x40 magnification using a Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope (Nikon Corporation, Japan) fitted with an Infinity 1–3C camera (Lumenera Corporation, Ottawa, ON, Canada).

## Data quantity
For each dataset in question 2: describe how much data (approximately) will be created during the course of the project (MB, GB, TB, etc). 

a.	Canned fruit image (storage test): <1GB

b.	Fruit quality:

(a)	Total anthocyanin content<10MB

(b)	Percent polymeric color and λvis-max <10MB

(c)	Color <10MB

(d)	Firmness <10MB

c.	Fruit skin cellular structures <1GB

# Roles and responsibilities

Copy paste what you wrote in DMP2 assignment

1.Identify the data management roles that must be accomplished by someone in the research project where you participate so that the data will be well managed. You can use the general roles that we worked with during class, but be specific to your project (roles worked during the class are archiving and preservation; data manager; protection of sensitive and protected data; instrumentation maintenance; data collection/data generation; data organization; metadata generation; quality control; data analysis; DMP implementation; access control; software creation and maintenance). You may need to talk to your advisor and discuss the roles and responsibilities of the researchers that participate in the project to complete this part of the assignment. Make sure that you address:

a.	Who is responsible for the implementation of the DMP

The implementation of a Data Management Plan (DMP) is typically the responsibility of the principal investigator (PI) or the team leader of a research project. This may include the project lead, laboratory head or research assistant, project coordinator, data manager, and other relevant personnel. For me, everyone who join or attend the project has to be responsible for the implementation of the DMP.

b.	(a)Other data management responsibilities. If these are not self explanatory provide a definition. (b) Is there any formal definition of roles and responsibilities in your research project? (c)Who is going to take in each of these roles in your project? No need to give me the actual names of people, you can say "PI" or "Grad student 2". (Who is responsible for making sure that what the DMP says will be done? & Who will do what?)
 
(a)	In my lab, we have 7 different data management responsibilities but all of them are the basic responsibility in DMP. Data backup and recovery; Data Security and Protection; Data curation and organization; metadata management; Data Sharing and Publishing; Data Preservation and Archiving; Data Compliance and Ethics.

(b)	Yes, my PI told me that we have the roles and responsibilities in my project, but most of the details I need to ask my PI. My PI ask me to collect data and share data with her only every week.

(c)	Here are the people who take in my project:
Data manager: PI
Data backup and recovery: PI / Grad student
Data Security and Protection: PI / Grad student
Data curation and organization: PI / Grad student
Metadata management: PI / Grad student
Data Sharing and Publishing: PI
Data Preservation and Archiving: PI / Grad student
Data Compliance and Ethics: PI / Grad student
Instrumentation maintenance: PI or instrument manufacturer
Data collection/data generation: Grad student
Quality control: PI 
Data analysis: Grad student, but PI need to see the result after data analysis.
DMP implementation: PI and Grad student
Access control: PI
Software creation and maintenance: main is PI / minor is Grad student / software developer

c.	Contingency plans: what would happen if somebody with data management responsibilities left the project? (What happens if somebody leaves the project?)

They need to return all lab notebooks, revoke data access on the cloud system, and give all raw data to PI before deleting data from their drives (like laptops or hard drives). In addition, they need to sign the form that they will not share the data with other people without a project leader (PI) agreement.

2.We saw in class that some data needs to be protected. (a) Is your data sensitive or confidential according to OSU's definition of sensitive and confidential data? (b) Does any of your research data need to be protected? If so, what is your plan to do so?

(a)	Yes, the data in my project is confidential data.

(b)	Yes, all my data needs to be protected.

(1) I separate lab notebooks to record data from different projects or experimental methods and store lab notebooks in a safe place that only me or PI can get them (like locked drawer) (Restrict the people and institutions that can access research data to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and use the data). 

(2) Backup data on the cloud system (like Box) and hard drive and share with PI (Regular backups of research data ensure recovery in the event of data loss or corruption.).

(3) Ensure that the physical facilities (e.g. servers, hard drives, etc.) where research data is stored are subject to appropriate security measures, such as CCTV monitoring, access control, etc.

(4) Sign contracts or agreements with partners or data providers to clarify the terms and conditions of data use and protection.

3.Describe where the data will be stored during the project. 

(1) Use lab notebooks to record data from different projects or experimental methods and store lab notebooks in a safe place that only me or PI can get them (like locked drawer). 

(2) Backup data on the cloud system (like Box) and hard drive and share with PI.

(3) Store the raw data in the lab computer.

4.Describe the backup strategy that you will follow for your datasets and other research materials in your project. Consider the following:

a.	How many copies, in total, will you have?
My answer: I have 3 copies of data (lab notebook, lab computer, and cloud system).

b.	Will the process be automatic or manual?
My answer: I like to do manual process because I don’t trust the automatic process.

c.	Which programs will you use?
My answer: I use Box and Excel to store data that I transfer data from lab notebooks to Excel and then upload to Box.

d.	If you use a shared network drive, is it backed up?
My answer: Yes, it backs up the data. For example, Box shows who update the file, who read the file, and version history.

e.	If you are going to use a cloud system, will you take any precautions to ensure that data will not be lost when you graduate?
My answer: For me, I will download the data and store it on different hard drives from the cloud system and keep lab notebooks synchronization updated.
